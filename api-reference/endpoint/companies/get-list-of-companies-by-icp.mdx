Parallel requests limit: 20 requests

Recommended timeout: 300 seconds

## Use Case:
Build a comprehensive list of companies to target for business opportunities.

## Possible values:

- `"num_of_followers"`: `["1-50", "51-100", "101-1000", "1001-5000", "5001+"]`
    
- `"headcounts"`: `["1-10", "11-50", "51-200", "201-500", "501-1000", "1001-5000", "5001-10000", "10 000+"]`
    

## Additional information:

- 20 Parallel processing supported (multiple threads)
    
- 1 company from results list = 1 credit
    
- First 1600 companies will be searched
    
- Companies with 0 employees and bad/null website (except cases when company hosted that `website-aggregator`) will not be shown
    
    - List of bad websites is listed below:
        
    - `'bit.ly', 'goo.gl', 'linktr.ee', 'buff.ly', 'sites.google.com', 'meta.com', 'facebook.com', 'instagram.com', 'linkedin.com', 'youtube.com', 'meetup.com', 'wixsite.com', 'wordpress.com', 'twitter.com', 'microage.ca', 'google.com', 'business.site', 'vimeo.com', 'medium.com', 'behance.net', 'github.io', 'calendly.com', 'upwork.com'`
        
- Companies Headcount:
    
    - Company headcount is shown as headcount text field from l-in/about page.
        
    - In the case of filtering companies on sales navigator, it filters depending on the exact headcount (exact number of employees).
        
    - e.g. Company A has 600 employees on L-In, and states its headcount range is 1000-5000.
        
        - 1\. Sales Navigator will show this company when filtering 500-1000 companies
            
        - 2\. L-In will show exact headcount as 600 and range-headcount as 1000-5000
            
        - 3\. This endpoint will output headcount as p.2
            
- Supported locations:
    
    - [List of Supported Locations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNW018ALP5NIenl7nnke8tqJmMsOZGkVdtt1MO9_yQU/edit#gid=0).
        
    - In case of inputting a location which is not listed you will receive a `ValidationError` (free request), with Hint what location you need to edit.
        
- Supported industries:
    
    - [List of Supported Industries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNW018ALP5NIenl7nnke8tqJmMsOZGkVdtt1MO9_yQU/edit#gid=1393250894). Use `industry_name` column as input.
        
    - In case of inputting an industry which is not listed you will receive a `ValidationError` (free request), with Hint what industry you need to edit.
        
- Supported departments:
    
    - [List of Supported departments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNW018ALP5NIenl7nnke8tqJmMsOZGkVdtt1MO9_yQU/edit#gid=358444705).
        
- limit_by rules:
    
    - limit_by should be > 1 and < 1600
        
- offset_by rules:
    
    - offset_by should be > 0 and < 1599
        
- Limit_by, offset_by additional info:
    
    - Without limit_by and offset_by parameters all companies from filters will be searched
        
    - Unsutable (bad website, or 0 headcount) companies will not be skipped with limit_by logic, but won't be charged or outputted.
        
        - e.g. `limit_by = 5`, `offset_by = 200`, and 3 of these companies do not have websites. Then you will see only 2 companies (despite the fact limit_by = 5).
            
        - Best Practice to use (Limit_by + Offset_by) is implementing pagination for Researcher’s workflow. For example, page 1 stands for 0-25 results, page 2 for 25-50, etc.
            
- keywords logic:
    
    - keywords from list of inputs will be separated in SN search header with “OR” parameter:
        
        - e.g. `[“academy”, “technician”]` will be passed to SN as “(academy) OR (technician)”.
            
        - Except cases when 1 word is passed. e.g. `[“world”]` will be passed to SN as `“world”` (without parentheses)
            
    - you are able to pass discrete logic, for example:
        
        - `[“(education AND management)”, “(project AND office)”]`
            
            - then SN search will look like: “(education AND management) OR (project AND office)”
                
        - same with NOT, OR, AND operators
            
    - validations:
        
        - keyword length must be {'<='} 40 symbols
            
        - keywords count must be {'<='} 10
            
        - keywords must be `without special characters (!@#$%^\\\\*(){}[]/\|)`
            
- headcount parameters:
    
    - List if supported headcounts `["1-10", "11-50", "51-200", "201-500", "501-1000", "1001-5000", "5001-10000", "10 000+"]`
        
- Caching:
    
    - For cases when companies appear in a different order or are duplicated with each subsequent request (after a certain period of time), caching of the order of companies has been added.
        
    - The actuality of the company data is 100%.
        
    - The order remains valid for the next 30 days, from 1 request.
        
    - To check when the order of companies was cached, the original key time_cached (type: timestamp) is used. If this is the first request that was not taken from the cache, then `time_cached=null`.
        
    - Results caching depends only on the match of the following parameters: `headcounts`, `locations`, `industries`, `keywords`
        
- Custom Parameter:
    
    - With a custom parameter you will receive 200 responses specifying that you need to refine your search, for cases when the count of companies by that criteria is > 1600. Such requests are also paid (fixed to 3 credits). Example of the output:
        

``` json
{
    "companies": [],
    "message": "Please refine your search",
    "amount": 3,
    "results_count": 198806
}

 ```

- parameter `strict`
    
    - with the strict parameter: `[“company_locations”]` will perform post-filtering on a strict occurrence of `company_locations`.
        
- parameter `exclude_ids`
    
    - exclude companies by linkedin_id or linkedin_urn (http://linkedin.com/company/company_urn/)
        
- parameter `exclude_domains`
    
    - exclude companies by domains
