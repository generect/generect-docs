## LinkedIn Filter Link Usage

The `linkedin_filter_link` parameter allows you to use a pre-built LinkedIn search URL instead of manually specifying individual search criteria. This is particularly useful when you have complex search filters already configured in LinkedIn.

### Supported LinkedIn URLs:
- **Sales Navigator People Search**: `https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=...`
- **Regular LinkedIn People Search**: `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=...`

### How it works:
1. Create your desired search in LinkedIn (Sales Navigator or regular search)
2. Copy the URL from the browser address bar
3. Use this URL as the `linkedin_filter_link` parameter
4. The API will extract and apply the search filters from your URL

### Usage Example:
```json
{
  "linkedin_filter_link": "https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2Ckeywords%3Amarketing%2CfirstName%3A%2ClastName%3A%2Ctitle%3A%2Ccompany%3A%2Cschool%3A%2CcontactInterest%3A%2CnetworkDepth%3A%2Clanguage%3A%2Clocation%3A%2Cindustry%3A%2CcurrentCompany%3A%2CpastCompany%3A%2CprofileLanguage%3A%2CnonprofitInterest%3A%2CfortuneOrGlobal500Size%3A%2CsalesPersona%3A)",
  "limit_by": 100
}
```

### Important Notes:
- When using `linkedin_filter_link`, you don't need to specify other filter parameters (locations, company_name, personas, etc.)
- Maximum limit when using `linkedin_filter_link` is 2400 results
- The URL must contain valid query parameters that can be parsed
- Both Sales Navigator and regular LinkedIn search URLs are supported

## Search by Company Name or Domain

You can search for leads by specifying company information in several ways:

### Using Company Name
Search for leads by providing the company name directly:

```json
{
  "company_name": "Microsoft",
  "personas": [
    ["Marketing", ["marketing", "digital marketing"], [], []]
  ],
  "limit_by": 50
}
```

### Using Email Domain
Search for leads by providing email addresses from the target company domain:

```json
{
  "emails": ["john@microsoft.com", "jane@microsoft.com"],
  "personas": [
    ["Sales", ["sales", "business development"], [], []]
  ],
  "limit_by": 30
}
```

**How Email Domain Search Works:**
1. The API automatically extracts the domain from provided email addresses
2. All emails must belong to the same domain (mixed domains are not allowed)
3. The domain is used to identify and search the target company
4. Maximum 500 email addresses per request

### Important Notes for Company/Domain Search:
- You must specify **exactly one** of: `company_id`, `company_link`, `company_name`, or `emails`
- When using `emails`, all email addresses must have the same domain
- The API will automatically find the LinkedIn company profile based on the provided information
- If no exact company match is found, the search may return an error or empty results

## Search Without Company Restriction

For broader lead searches across all companies, use the `without_company` parameter:

```json
{
  "without_company": true,
  "locations": ["New York, New York, United States"],
  "personas": [
    ["Tech Leaders", ["CTO", "VP Engineering", "Tech Director"], ["VP", "Director"], []]
  ],
  "limit_by": 100
}
```

### How Without Company Search Works:
1. Searches across all LinkedIn profiles, not limited to specific companies
2. Useful for finding leads based on job titles, locations, and other criteria
3. Higher limit of 2400 results available
4. May have usage restrictions based on your account plan

### Important Notes for Without Company Search:
- `without_company: true` removes the requirement to specify company information
- Maximum limit of 2400 results when using this mode
- May have daily usage limits depending on your subscription
- Combines well with location, persona, and other filtering criteria
- Cannot be used together with `company_id`, `company_link`, or `company_name`
