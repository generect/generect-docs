title: What is MCP?
---

**MCP** is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations.
This list focuses on production-ready and experimental MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

In the context of **Generect**, MCP enables you to chat with an LLM, and it can **query and search information from the Generect API** and process the data for you.  
You don't need to specify parameters for searches manually â€” **the LLM will determine them automatically**.

Instead of searching leads yourself, you can simply ask:

`Find 5 chieft leads from Google and compare them with 5 chieft leads from Microsoft.`

The LLM will use MCP, fetch all data and write a summary.
