title: Common problems
description: This page describes common problems you may encounter when using **MCP with Generect API**, and how to solve them.
---

---

## 401 Unauthorized error
**Cause:** Your API key is invalid or missing.  
**Solution:**  
- Make sure you replaced `your-api-key` with your actual key.
- Do not remove the word `Token` from the value — it should look like: `GENERECT_API_KEY="Token your-real-key"`
- Ask for a status for this key.

---

## Timeout error
**Cause:** The API request took longer than the default timeout (1 minute). For example, a lead search may take longer with very broad filters.
**Solution:**  
- Increase the timeout limit in your MCP configuration (default: `60000` ms).
```json
"GENERECT_TIMEOUT_MS": "180000"
```
- Try refining your query (e.g., add more filters for leads or companies).

## MCP server does not appear in the client

**Cause**: Configuration file is invalid, or the MCP server didn't start.
**Solution**:
- Double-check JSON syntax and content in your config (`claude_desktop_config.json`, Cursor config). NPM should be `generect-ultimate-mcp`
- Try setting MCP_DEBUG=1 to see logs when starting the MCP.
- Restart your client after editing the configuration.

### LLM doesn't call MCP tools

**Cause**: The LLM decides when to call external tools — it may not always trigger them.
**Solution**:
- Rephrase your request in a way that makes tool usage more likely (e.g., explicitly ask to “search leads”).
- Check that the MCP server is shown as active in the client's settings.
